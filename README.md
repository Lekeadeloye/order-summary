## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I leant how to use CSS grid, I know a bit about it already but this challenge allowed me to put what I knew into practice. I also learnt the Mobile-first design workflow. I very much prefer this method. I had some trouble centering elements with CSS grid but I eventually got the hang of it. I also learnt about the different ways to use SVG elements.


### Continued development

Areas for me to continue to focus on in the future are:

- CSS grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML
- Accessibility
